This is an OpenCart payment module that communicates with a bitcoin client using JSON RPC.

This code accurately converts any Mt.Gox-compatible currency to BTC using the up-to-the-minute Mt.Gox values for average trade vaule and last trade value.  It is completely self contained and requires no cron jobs or external hardware other than a properly configured bitcoind server.  Every order creates a new bitcoin address for payment and gives it a label corresponding to the order_id of the order.  It installs like any other OpenCart plugin and it is completely integrated with OpenCart.

This extension has been tested with OpenCart versions between 1.5.2.1 and 1.5.5.1.

# Dependencies

This extension now requires previous installation of [vQmod](https://code.google.com/p/vqmod/) and will not run properly without it. vQmod enables making changes to core OpenCart functionality without actually editing the core OpenCart files.

# Installation

1. Install vQmod.
2. Upload all files maintaining OpenCart folder structure.
3. Install the payment module in the admin console (Extensions > Payments > Bitcoin > Install).
4. Edit the payment module settings (Extensions > Payments > Bitcoin > Edit).
5. Run at least one test order through checkout up until payment (no payment required).  The first order initializes the Bitcoin currency and will return 0 BTC for the order total.
